This folder contains two different surface files for tracer release:
wsv.inp.001
and 
_norelease_wsv.inp.001

As the name gives away, the 2nd file has a release of zero everywhere.
This was originally meant to first simulate XXX number of hours with no release and only later (after spinup) switch on the release in the simulation..

For now: restarting the simulation (with different conditions) might be a bit challenging from the start. So, we can discuss that later.
